Go-Vite-Chat
Welcome to Go-Vite-Chat! This project is a simple web chat application built using Go for the backend and React with Vite for the frontend.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Backend
Navigate to the server directory.
Run go run main.go to start the Go API server.
Frontend
Navigate to the client directory.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Run npm run dev to start the frontend development server.
Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the web chat application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Important Note
There is a peculiar issue with browser compatibility when hosting the application. Currently, it only works on Microsoft Edge when accessed through the hosted URL: https://go-vite-chat.vercel.app/. However, users can modify the React websocket URL to localhost instead of the hosted backend URL to make it work on any browser. We are actively investigating and resolving this issue.

Technologies Used
